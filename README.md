# smart-sorting-transfer-learning-for-identifying-rotten-fruits-and-vegetables
This project aims to automate the sorting of fruits and vegetables by detecting whether they're fresh or rotten using machine learning, specifically transfer learning. The goal is to enhance food quality control by reducing manual inspection errors and making the process faster and more scalable for farms, grocery chains, and food distribution centers.

 How It Works
1. Data Collection & Preprocessing
- High-quality images of fresh and rotten produce are collected.
- Images are categorized and augmented (e.g., rotations, flips, lighting changes) to increase model robustness.
- The dataset is divided into training, validation, and test sets.
2. Model Development with Transfer Learning
- A pre-trained CNN model like MobileNet, ResNet, or Inception is imported.
- The final layer is replaced and fine-tuned for binary classification: Fresh vs Rotten.
- The model learns relevant visual features such as discoloration, mold, or texture.
3. Real-time Integration
- A camera captures images of produce as they move on a conveyor.
- The trained model classifies each item in real-time.
- Based on the output, a robotic arm or mechanical actuator sorts the item into the correct bin.
4. System Architecture
- Frontend (Client): A user interface- (web or desktop) displays results, logs, and system status.
- Backend (Server): Hosts the trained model, handles image processing, and controls hardware.
- Database: Stores classification data, timestamps, images, and analytics for traceability.
 Why It Matters
This kind of system:
- Cuts down on food waste 
- Saves labor and inspection time 
- Increases consistency in quality control 
- Can be scaled and adapted for other agricultural classification tasks
